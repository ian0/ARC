## Assignment 3: Hand-coding solutions for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus

This repository is a fork of the [ARC repository](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC/) by [Fran√ßois Chollet](https://github.com/fchollet).

For more information please see the above links or see  [Chollet The Measure of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547)

## Aim of Assignment

The aim of this assignment is to pick three tasks from the ARC/data/training directory and create a separate hand coded solution for each task.

## Selected Tasks

The tasks I selected are:

* c1d99e64.json
* d037b0a7.json
* ed36ccf7.json


## Program Execution

Each program is runnable at the command-line.  Example commands are:\
```$ python solution_c1d99e64.py data/c1d99e64.json```\
```$ python solution_d037b0a7.py data/d037b0a7.json```\
```$ python solution_ed36ccf7.py data/ed36ccf7.json```
